A few years ago, I made [a LaTeX beamer theme](https://github.com/WannabeSmith/beamertheme-pittsburgh/) for presentations. In a nutshell, I began to adore the types of slides that could be made in Keynote on macOS but noticed three shortcomings:

1. Keynote does not run on Linux,
2. Its files are large relative to their content, and
3. Its math fonts don't match the LaTeX ones.

Points 2 and 3 are minor annoyances but 1 is a deal-breaker for me. Fortunately, beamer is cross-platform, is very space-efficient, and math fonts are obviously native. However, I could not find a theme with the aesthetic sensibilities of Keynote so I attempted to make one and I have been using it ever since. Some screenshots of demo slides can be found below.
