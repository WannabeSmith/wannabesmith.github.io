I recently completed my PhD in [Statistics at CMU](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/).

I am broadly interested in statistics, machine learning, and probability, often with an eye towards anytime-valid sequential inference, [e-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-values), causal inference, and privacy. 

In the fall of 2024, I will begin as a [Miller](https://miller.berkeley.edu/) postdoctoral fellow in [Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) hosted by [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/).
