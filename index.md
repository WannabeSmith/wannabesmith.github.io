I'm a PhD student in [Statistics at CMU](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/).

I am broadly interested in statistics, machine learning, and probability, often with an eye towards anytime-valid sequential inference, [e-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-values), causal inference, and privacy.
